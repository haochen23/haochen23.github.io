                <div class="entry-content"> <p>Online shopping now makes our life much easier than it used to be. Without the need of going out and visting a shopping mall or a grocery store, we can buy anything we want through e-shopping. But online shopping comes with its own caveats. One of the biggest challenges, and I guess almost every would face, is verifying the authenticity of a product. Is it as good as advertised on the e-commerce site? Will the product has a good quality? Are the reviews given by other customers really true or are they false advertising, or are they fake or bots' reviews? These are important questions customers need to ask before splurging their money. I believe there are a bunch of people like me, who believe in customers' reviews much much more than the fancy product description of an item. In making our decision in buying a product, if most customers' reviews talking about how good it is, then it is probably a really good product. If every customer talks bad about a product, I am afraid I will not buy it no matter how good it shows me in the product description. And in some funny cases, which is quite often from my perspective, some users like to leave a high rating or score no matter how bad they think the product is. Oh god, this is tricky!</p> </div><!-- entry-content -->

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>This post summarizes the top 50 most valuable Matplotlib &amp; Seaborn data visualizations in data science. It can be taken as a data visualization handbook for you to look up for useful visulaization.  The 50 visualizations are categorized into 7 different application scenarios, and this post would mainly focuses on the first two categories, shown as follows: Correlation, Deviation, Ranking, Distribution, Composition, Change, and Groups. The whole content is divided into three parts, and this post is Part I. We will cover the first two categories in Part I.</p> </div><!-- entry-content -->

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>The basic aim of this notebook is to predict new Airbnb users' first destination country based a historical dataset. This work involves a considerable amount of data cleansing work. After the dataset is cleaned and preprocessed, I use a popular xgboost classifier as the prediction model, and grid searching with 3-fold cross-validation to find the most suitable parameters for the classifier. If you are interested in finding more about the dataset or the xgboost classifier, please follow along this article.</p> </div><!-- entry-content -->

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>Coding from scratch. To better understand the process of Naive Bayes model training. And in the end, we make another Naive Bayes Classifier through normal workflow using sklearn. In machine learning, naive Bayes classifiers are a family of simple "probabilistic classifiers" based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features. A naive Bayes classifier considers each of these features to be independent to each other. That why it is referred as "Naive".</p> </div><!-- entry-content -->

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>The basic aim of this post is to predict customer churn for a certain bank i.e. which customer is going to leave this bank service. Fully-connected neural networks with different architectures will be explored and compared. Since this is a binary prediction , logistic regression may also works pretty well. Feel free to give it a shot~</p> </div><!-- entry-content -->
