                <div class="entry-content"> <p>Sentiment Analysis refers to the use of natural language processing, text analysis, computational linguistics, and biometrics to systematically identify, extract, quantify, and study affective states and subjective information. Sentiment analysis on tweets can be extremely useful. By analyzing the tweets, we can find the sentiment of people on certain affair, understand people's opinion. Also it can help us make right strategies/reactions. In this post, our main goal is to build a model to identify tweets with racist or sexist sentiment.</p> </div><!-- entry-content -->

                <div class="entry-content"> <p>Online shopping now makes our life much easier than it used to be. Without the need of going out and visting a shopping mall or a grocery store, we can buy anything we want through e-shopping. But online shopping comes with its own caveats. One of the biggest challenges, and I guess almost every would face, is verifying the authenticity of a product. Is it as good as advertised on the e-commerce site? Will the product has a good quality? Are the reviews given by other customers really true or are they false advertising, or are they fake or bots' reviews? These are important questions customers need to ask before splurging their money. I believe there are a bunch of people like me, who believe in customers' reviews much much more than the fancy product description of an item. In making our decision in buying a product, if most customers' reviews talking about how good it is, then it is probably a really good product. If every customer talks bad about a product, I am afraid I will not buy it no matter how good it shows me in the product description. And in some funny cases, which is quite often from my perspective, some users like to leave a high rating or score no matter how bad they think the product is. Oh god, this is tricky!</p> </div><!-- entry-content -->
